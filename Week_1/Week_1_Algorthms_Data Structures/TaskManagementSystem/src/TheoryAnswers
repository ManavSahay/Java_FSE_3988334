Understand Linked Lists:

1 -> Explain the different types of linked lists (Singly Linked List, Doubly Linked List).

Ans -> 
Types of Linked Lists

Singly Linked List:

Structure: Each node contains data and a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the sequence.
Traversal: Can be traversed in one direction only, from the head to the last node.
Memory Usage: Uses less memory per node compared to doubly linked lists due to only one reference.

Doubly Linked List:

Structure: Each node contains data and two references, one to the next node and one to the previous node.
Traversal: Can be traversed in both directions, forward and backward.
Memory Usage: Uses more memory per node compared to singly linked lists due to an extra reference.



Analysis

1 -> Analyze the time complexity of each operation.

Ans -> 
Add Task:

Best Case: O(1) - Adding to an empty list.
Average/Worst Case: O(n) - Traversing to the end of the list to add the task.

Search Task:

Best Case: O(1) - The task is the first element.
Average/Worst Case: O(n) - The task could be anywhere in the list or not present.

Traverse Tasks:

Best/Average/Worst Case: O(n) - Must traverse the entire list to print all tasks.

Delete Task:

Best Case: O(1) - The task is the first element.
Average/Worst Case: O(n) - The task could be anywhere in the list or not present.


2 -> Discuss the advantages of linked lists over arrays for dynamic data.

Ans -> 
Dynamic Size: Linked lists can easily grow and shrink in size by adding or removing nodes, unlike arrays which have a fixed size.

Efficient Insertions/Deletions: Insertions and deletions can be done efficiently (O(1) if the position is known) without shifting elements, which is required in arrays.

Memory Usage: Memory is allocated as needed for linked lists, whereas arrays may have unused allocated memory if the array size is larger than needed.

Flexibility: Linked lists allow for easier implementation of other data structures like stacks, queues, and graphs.
